// To use the STL in your C++ code, you typically start by including the appropriate header files, which are located in the <algorithm>, <numeric>, <array>, <deque>, <forward_list>, <list>, <vector>, <map>, <set>, <unordered_map>, and <unordered_set> headers.

// Once you have the necessary header files included, you can start using the STL containers and algorithms to help you write your code.

// Here are some common ways to use the STL:

// Containers:

// vector: a dynamic array that can grow or shrink in size.
// list: a doubly linked list that allows for constant-time insertions and deletions anywhere in the list.
// deque: a double-ended queue that allows for constant-time insertions and deletions at both ends.
// map: an associative array that maps keys to values and provides fast lookups based on keys.
// set: an unordered collection of unique elements that provides fast lookups and insertions.
// Algorithms:

// sort: sorts the elements in a range.
// binary_search: performs a binary search on a sorted range.
// lower_bound/upper_bound: returns the first position where a specified value can be inserted into a sorted range without breaking the order.
// count: counts the number of elements in a range that match a specific value.
// max_element/min_element: returns the maximum/minimum element in a range.
// Each of these components of the STL has a detailed documentation and examples that show how to use them effectively. You can refer to the C++ reference manual or online resources for more information.

// introduction STL;
// STL --> Standard template library
// Library of what?
//  --> Generic Class and Functions

// Why use STL?
//  --> Reuse = Well tested componend
//  --> Time saving

// components of STL:
// --> (1) Containers  i]-> store data
//                    ii]-> use template class
//
// (2) Algorithms  i]-> Sorting
//                 ii]-> Searching
//                 iii]-> Count
//                 iv]-> Transforming Data
//  (3) Iterators   i]-> object points to an element in a containers
//                  ii]-> Handled just like pointers
//                 iii]-> Connects Algorithms with containers
